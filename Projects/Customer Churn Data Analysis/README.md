Working on this project taught me a lot about how to understand and communicate data.

    The countplot of churned vs retained customers helped me quickly see how many customers left the company. It gave me a clear idea of the problem.

    Looking at churn by gender, subscription type, and contract length showed me how different groups of customers behave. I learned how to break down data and compare categories.

    Using boxplots for age and tenure helped me see how long customers stay and whether age affects churn. It made me realize how useful visual tools are for spotting patterns.

    Charts for usage frequency, support calls, payment delays, and total spend helped me understand which customer behaviors might be warning signs for churn.

    The correlation heatmap was really helpful to see which features are related to each other. It made me more careful about choosing the right variables.

Overall, these visualizations helped me go beyond just numbers. I learned how to ask better questions, explore real business problems, and explain my findings clearly using Python
