Working on this project taught me a lot about how to understand and communicate data.

•	The countplot of churned vs retained customers helped me quickly see how many customers left the company. It gave me a clear idea of the problem.

•	Looking at churn by gender, subscription type, and contract length showed me how different groups of customers behave. I learned how to break down data and compare categories.

•	Charts for usage frequency, support calls, payment delays, and total spend helped me understand which customer behaviors might be warning signs for churn.

•	The correlation heatmap was really helpful to see which features are related to each other. It made me more careful about choosing the right variables.

Overall, these visualizations helped me go beyond just numbers. I learned how to ask better questions, explore real business problems, and explain my findings clearly using Python.

<h1>What I Learned from SQL Analysis</h1>

Writing SQL queries to answer real business questions taught me how to explore data in a structured and meaningful way. Here's how each question helped me:

1.	Count of total customers :
Helped me get a sense of the dataset size and how to filter rows with COUNT(*) and WHERE conditions.
2.	Churn rate :
   I learned how to calculate percentages using COUNT, GROUP BY, and CASE WHEN. This helped me understand class imbalance and why churn is a business concern.
3.	Churn by Gender:
   Using GROUP BY Gender, I compared how men and women churn differently. This taught me how to segment data and find patterns in specific groups.
4.	Churn by Subscription Type:
   I explored how different services (like Internet, Streaming, etc.) relate to churn. It showed me how customer behavior is tied to product usage.
5.	Average Metrics for Churned vs Non-Churned : Using AVG() with GROUP BY Churn, I compared features like monthly charges, tenure, and support calls. This helped me learn how to summarize numeric data and compare two groups.
6.	Contract Length and Churn: I used SQL joins or grouped summaries to understand how long-term vs short-term contracts affect churn. This helped me link customer choices to retention.
7.  Top Risk Segment – Who’s Churning the Most? : I combined multiple columns (like senior citizens with month-to-month contracts) using conditions in WHERE and GROUP BY to identify high-risk groups. It taught me how to layer logic into my queries.
8.	Quantify the Risk: I learned how to calculate churn percentages by segment, which is useful in real business cases to prioritize retention efforts. It showed me how to turn raw data into action points.

This process not only improved my SQL skills (joins, aggregation, filtering, grouping), but also helped me think like an analyst — asking the right questions, checking assumptions, and explaining results clearly.
