<h1>ðŸ“± Social Media Engagement Analysis<h1>
<h2>ðŸ“Œ Project Overview</h2>
This project explores how users engage with social media content across platforms and campaigns. I used SQL for querying and filtering, and Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for data cleaning, visualization, and deriving insights. The goal was to understand what drives user engagement and sentiment.
<h3> Business Questions Solved using sql</h3>
1.	What is the average engagement rate by platform?

2.	Which are the top 5 most liked posts?

3.	How are posts distributed daily?

4.	What is the sentiment distribution by campaign?

5.	How does user sentiment and engagement vary across platforms and campaign phases?

6.	What are the most engaging post types (based on engagement rate)?

7.	How does engagement rate vary by day of the week?

8.	What is the overall distribution of sentiment labels?

9.	Which are the top 5 emotions that correlate with high engagement?

10.	What is the average toxicity score by platform?

11.	Which campaigns perform best based on average engagement?

12.	Which users have the highest past sentiment averages (Influencer/User behavior)?

<h4> Charts Created in Python<h4>

To support these questions, I created the following visualizations using Python:

â€¢	Average Engagement Rate by Platform â€“ Bar chart comparing performance across platforms

â€¢	Sentiment Distribution â€“ bar chart showing overall sentiment breakdown

â€¢	Engagement Type by Emotion Type â€“ boxplot chart mapping likes, shares, comments to emotion labels

â€¢	Top Campaigns by Average Engagement Rate â€“ Ranked bar chart to identify best-performing campaigns

â€¢	Engagement Rate Over Time â€“ Line plot showing engagement trends over days or weeks

<h5> Data Cleaning Steps<h5>

â€¢	Handled missing values and inconsistent formats using Pandas

â€¢	Converted timestamps to datetime format for temporal analysis

â€¢	Standardized sentiment/emotion labels

â€¢	Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns to simplify analysis

<h6> What I Learned<h6>

â€¢	How to extract meaningful insights from social media data using real business questions.

â€¢	Applied Python for data wrangling, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

â€¢	Improved my understanding of engagement metrics, sentiment analysis, and platform performance.

â€¢	Learned how to communicate findings visually using charts that directly answer stakeholder questions.

â€¢	Practiced interpreting emotional and behavioral data to support marketing and content decisions.

â€¢	Improved my ability to write SQL queries to group, filter, and summarize social media data.

â€¢	Learned to use Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to build insightful charts.
